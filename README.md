# <center> Group 18 Library</center>

ECSE 321 â€“ Introduction to Software Engineering, Fall 2021, Project Group 18

****

## Project Overview
The library system provides a website and an app to support various interactions between the library users, the librarians and library facilities.

The system allows users to create the user account, do operations with library items (i.e. borrow
, reserve, checkout, return and renew) or register events hosted in library. Librarian can also manage the library by setting opening hours, creating new items, deleting user accounts etc. via the system. The system also gives librarian privileges  (i.e. hire and fire librarians) to manage the library.

The project is organized in four Agile sprints. 

The final deliverable consists of an Android app and a website for this appointment booking app.

The project is developed with the 3-tier architecture idea. 
It has a database access object tier that load and save the necessary data into a database, 
a service tier that processes business logic and a web tier that 
allows the read and write opeations on the displays UI surface on the website or the mobile frontend.
